# M3Code
I learned how to comment(give authorship,date and simple explanation of what the program does) in the previous moduls.
I learned how to print "Hello World", ask a question using "input", name the string, if/else conditions, and some math calculations.
All these experience above helped me to do Module 3: Lab Activity.
